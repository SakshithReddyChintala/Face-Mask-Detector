# Face-Mask-Detector
COVID-19 face mask detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.
In order to train a custom face mask detector, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps :

1.Training: Here weâ€™ll focus on loading our face mask detection dataset from disk, training a model (using Keras/TensorFlow) on this dataset, and then serializing the face mask detector to disk

2.Deployment: Once the face mask detector is trained, we can then move on to loading the mask detector, performing face detection, and then classifying each face as with_mask or without_mask

The dataset of with_mask and without_mask is pretty large, i couldn't upload the files. So incase if you are intrested to work on this project , you can reach me out through email:sakshith2001@gmail.com
